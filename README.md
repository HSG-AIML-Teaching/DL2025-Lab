Welcome Fall Semester 2025 students to our course **Deep Learning**, taught by **Prof. Dr. Damian Borth**.

Lectures and hands-on lab courses alternate to provide a better learning experience in this course. The materials for Deep Learning labs are available and accessible through this repository.

The the lab content is based on [Python](https://www.python.org), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). This repository is supported by the course TAs [Konstantinos Tzevelekakis](https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/entities/person/Konstantinos_Ioannis_Tzevelekakis) and [Aron Asefaw](https://ics.unisg.ch/the-institute/about-us/team/detail/person-id/51e76fca-37cd-4d91-a230-12a6540ec575/). Lab notebooks are developed by [Hamed Hemati](https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/persons/8884).



Happy Coding!

## How To Run the Course Code Lab Notebooks

#### Option 1: Google Colab Environment

Similar to binder, you just have to click the Colab badge next to the Notebooks below. All you need is a Google login
(e.g., your login information for gmail) and you can use this service at no charge.
Two advantages of Colab are that (1) you can save your
Notebooks directly into your Google Drive and read data from there, and (2) Google provides you with some limited GPU capabilities
free of charge (this will be an interesting feature for the coding challenge.)

#### Option 2: Local Python Installation

If you prefer to run Notebooks locally on your computer, you will need to install Python. If you choose to do so,
we recommend to install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a package that combines the
latest version of Python with the most common supplemental modules for data science and machine learning, as well
as a Jupyter Notebook server that runs on your computer locally. Anaconda
[installers](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) are available
for the most common operating systems, as well as some
[detailed installation guides](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

If you need help running Python and/or Jupyter Notebooks, please don't hesitate to contact us (see below)!
